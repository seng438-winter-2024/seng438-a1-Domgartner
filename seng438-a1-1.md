# Introduction

#### An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual functional testing before this lab:

- Our understanding of exploratory testing is that it is an unscripted testing approach, where testers explore the application, and execute tests based on their observations. This type of testing is often used to uncover defects that might not be identified through a scripted testing approach such as input validation, buffer overflows, and unresolvable actions (such as attempting to withdraw a value that is not a multiple of 20). Testers rely on their experience, intuition, and creativity to find bugs and issues during exploratory testing.
- On the other hand, our understanding of manual functional testing is the idea that a tester follows test cases (test suite). Which ensures that the software or application functions as intended. 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

- In the exploratory testing phase, the approach is to explore common failures in programs. We also will explore the explicit requirements defined in the High Level Requirements (Appendix B). This includes:
    - Customers must enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for validation.
    - Allow withdrawals in multiples of $20.00 from linked accounts.
    - Allow customers to enter the deposit amount for bank verification.
    - Send a message to the bank once the envelope is deposited.
    - Provide balance information for any account linked to the card.
    - Allow customers to cancel a transaction in progress.
    - Handle transaction completion as per bank's approval.
    - Provide printed receipts for each successful transaction.
    - Include a key-operated switch for starting and stopping customer service.
    - Ensure the machine can only be turned off when not servicing a customer.
    - Maintain an internal transaction log.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

- Exploratory testing and functional testing represent distinct approaches to evaluating whether an application aligns with its specified requirements. Each technique offers unique benefits and flaws.
Exploratory testing allowed for the freedom to freely explore and test the application outside of the restrictions of the specified test cases. As a result, exploratory testing allowed us to effectively explore the application and discover bugs that were not directly tied to the previously recorded test cases. It allows testers to explore the application organically as a potential user may use the application. This user-centric method mirrors the logical flow of user interactions, offering a more intuitive testing experience. 
In contrast, manual functional testing excels in providing a structured and thorough testing plan. Despite uncertainties about uncovering all possible bugs during the exploratory testing phase, the manual approach follows a structured plan with a clear start and end. The test suite covers multiple scenarios for each function, leading to the rediscovery bugs found in exploratory testing and the identification of additional bugs that were missed in the exploratory testing phase. 
With documentation, manual functional testing excels, as bug reports are more straightforward to compile, with all necessary information already defined in the test suite. In exploratory testing, keen observations were required to record all the necessary information in order to recreate the bugs.
The primary advantage of exploratory testing over manual functional testing lies in its dynamic bug discovery. Uncovering one bug may lead to the identification of a cascade of related bugs not accounted for in manual testing. The tradeoff between exploratory and manual testing becomes apparent in terms of efficiency, with exploratory testing potentially overlooking basic functional errors, while manual scripting tests ensure comprehensive coverage of all basic functionalities.


-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

- During our manual, non-scripted testing phase, we identified a wide range of software failures, from issues due to inadequate input validation to various logical errors affecting the software's operations. These findings highlighted the critical importance of robust testing to uncover hidden vulnerabilities and complex bugs that might not be evident in more structured testing environments. The peer review process of these defect reports was instrumental in refining our approach, allowing us to deepen our understanding of the issues at hand and improve our testing. Through collaborative discussions and feedback, we not only addressed the identified defects more effectively but also enhanced our understanding of the software and testing practices.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

- We managed pair testing by splitting into two pairs, where both pairs performed exploratory testing usings the guidelines above and recorded any defects found. Once both pairs finished we compared the results and talked about the different bugs each pair found. The next step was the manual scripted testing and regression testing. We completed this step by splitting the manual scripted testing in half and letting the first pair run through the first 20 tests and the second pair run through the other 20 tests. Each pair recorded the results in the Azure testing board and we repeated this same process for version 1.1. The rest of the lab report including this response was divided equally making sure that each member was able to contribute their ideas.  

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

- Navigating the complexity of a project like an ATM simulation, with its extensive functionalities and subtle operational factors, posed challenges in our testing efforts. The intricacies required us to gain a thorough understanding to accurately assess the system's behaviours. By delving deep into the nuances of the project and meticulously analysing the intended versus actual behaviours across diverse scenarios, we were able to effectively identify and address discrepancies, a crucial step in uncovering potential issues. This process not only enhanced the software's reliability but also provided valuable insights into user experience improvements. Our ability to uncover a diverse set of problems can be attributed to our strategy of dividing our focus across various program aspects, despite occasional overlaps in our efforts. We overcame this challenge by centralising our bug reporting, which streamlined our process and ensured a comprehensive understanding, ultimately leading to high-quality testing outcomes.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

- As a group we really enjoyed this lab, it was helpful getting us familiar with the testing process, and using some concepts we learned in class in a real time environment. Additionally, we all learned a lot about pair testing, and how to use Azures testing board correctly to write out all the test suites. We found the lab document itself great and very easy to understand.
